## Technologies

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) 
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) (optional, if you need to manage Firebase from the command line)
  
### Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Add an Android/iOS/Web app to your Firebase project.
3. Download the `google-services.json` or `GoogleService-Info.plist` file depending on your platform and place it in your project (usually in `android/app` for Android, or `ios/Runner` for iOS).
4. Enable Firestore in your Firebase project.
5. Set up Firestore collections:
   - **students**: Each student record contains fields `name` and `index`.
   - **news**: Each news record contains fields `title`, `time`, `news`, and `from`.

### Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/your-dashboard.git
    cd your-dashboard
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. Run the app on your preferred device or emulator:

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

### Configuration

Ensure that your Flutter app is properly configured to connect with Firebase:

- Update the `android/app/build.gradle` and `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to match the settings provided in the Firebase console.

## Usage

### Student Management

1. **Add a New Student**: Fill in the student name and index in the provided form and click the "Add Student" button. The student will be added to Firestore.
2. **Edit or Delete Students**: Use the list view to see all the students. You can select a student to edit or delete their record.

### News Management

1. **Add News**: Fill in the news title, time, and content, then click the "Add News" button.
2. **View or Edit News**: Select an existing news article to view or edit it.
3. **Delete News**: Delete any article by selecting it from the list and clicking the delete button.


## Future Enhancements

- **Search Feature**: Add a search bar to quickly find students or news.
- **Admin Authentication**: Implement Firebase Authentication for admins to control access to the dashboard.
- **Student Sorting**: Add the ability to sort students by name or index.
- **News Scheduling**: Add functionality to schedule news articles for future publication.
